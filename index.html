            <p>In November 2010 after partcipating in round 2 of the Guitar Center national "drum off" competition, 
                I decided to enlist in the US Army. In March 2010, I attended Basic Training at Fort Benning, Georgia. 
                I attended Advanced Individual "MOS" Training at Fort Gordon, Georgia as a 25L Cable Installer Maintainer, 
                or Fiber Optic Technician. After Graduating from AIT, I deployed to K-16 Air Base in South Korea until October 2011.
